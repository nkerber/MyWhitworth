Yet too often the disasters they trigger are either attributed by Christians to a cosmic fall and God’s judgment or are considered inherently meaningless and unpredictable. \r\nDr. Jonathan Moo, Professor of New Testament and Environmental Studies and the Edward B. Lindaman Endowed Chair, will explore how in Scripture ‘disaster’ often functions as ‘apocalypse’, serving to reveal underlying realities in human society while displaying divine power and mystery. Above all we will focus on the response to disaster to which God’s people are called, as seen through a few biblical examples and especially God’s own response in the person of Jesus Christ. \r\n",
