                <td><div align ="center"><b>Nate Kerber</b>
                <br>Nate is a 2nd year at Whitworth University, a real genius among his peers. Considered to be the next Zuckerburg, he has the knowledge and the skills to take MyWhitworth to the Moon. 
                <br><br>On a more serious note, Nate is studying Computer Science and had the vision for MyWhitworth from the beginning. He’s seen and used previous Whitworth applications and they’ve seemed clunky and not very user friendly. Nate’s vision behind MyWhitworth was to help make navigating Whitworth as easy and pain-less as possible.

                <td><div align="center"><b>Christian Williams</b>
                <br>Christian, a 4th year student at Whitworth, is likened more towards a young Elon Musk. With his visionary thinking and persistence, he is one to make any idea possible. His determination will take MyWhitworth to Mars.
                <br><br>Back to the serious note. Christian is studying Business Marketing and wanted the chance to learn more about Computer Science. He thought Nate’s vision of MyWhitworth was the perfect fit to not only learn Computer Science, but to also help the Whitworth community as a whole. As long as Christian's helping make Whitworth a better place, he’s excited to learn.
